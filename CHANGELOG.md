Dracula Solid
Dracula got a bald-cut âœ‚ â€” Seamless â€¢ no-borders â€¢ distraction-free â€¢ minimal â€¢ all-one-color

## 2.0 Major
- ðŸ’„ Total rebranding from "Dracula.min" to "Dracula Solid"
  - After further research I realized that all solid themes are flat, but not all flat themes are solid (solid is a subset of flat-style) i.e. "solid" is alot closer to what I'm going for
- ðŸ’„ Gave dracula a bald-cut (new icon)
- ðŸš€ Added "Dracula Solid White" && "Dracula Solid White Darker" themes!
- ðŸŽ¨ Complete refactor of build scripts for readability
