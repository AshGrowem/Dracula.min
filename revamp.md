Dracu.min gives you a fully-immserive Dracula-style editor with zero borders or seams (other than scroll bars and shadows). It also features a handful of variants (including light themes!), each with dark and light syntax options.

I find I can pay much better attention to my code when there are less eye-catching elements strewn about. This theme is a direct fork of [Dracula Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) and takes after the beautiful borderless [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme), both of which inspired me to create this.

# Roadmap
- Command Palette options to toggle default and "darker" syntax
- Settings to control which themes are visible and registered (declutter themepicker menu)
