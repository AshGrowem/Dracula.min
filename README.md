## Light Theme Methodology

When I first attempted to create a Dracula Light theme I simply switched the background [`#282a36`](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme#color-palette) and foreground [`#f8f8f2`](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme#color-palette) colors to see what would hapen.

![Dracula Flat Light (no contrast adjust) Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashrafhadden/dracula-flat/master/screenshots/dracula-flat-light_no_contrast_adjust.png)

As it turns out, most dark theme colors only work for dark themes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è When you only switch the background and foreground, the syntax hightlighting colors
are often left with very poor contrast. In the screenshot above, Yellow is nearly invisible.

### [Chroma.js](https://vis4.net/chromajs) to the rescue!

Thanks to the powerful color manipulation library [Chroma.js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js), I was able to darken all the syntax colors using it's [color.darken()](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#color-darken) method.

```js
currentColor = chroma(currentColor).darken(1.5);
```

![Dracula Flat (darken equally) Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashrafhadden/dracula-flat/master/screenshots/dracula-flat_darken_equally.png)

However as you can see, darkening all the syntax colors equally doesn't quite cut it. The yellows are still a bit too light and the file explorer selection highlight on the left is difficult to see. Darkening each color manually and checking by eye seemed like hard work üëÄ, so being the lazy programmer that I am, I decided to try and automate it!

#### [chroma.contrast()](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#chroma-contrast)

Using Chroma's [.contrast method](https://vis4.net/chromajs/#chroma-contrast) I was able to create a [`while` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while) that darkened each syntax color indefinitely until it's contrast ratio reached 4.5. 4.5:1 is the WCAG's [_"Contrast (Minimum)"_](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum) recommendation for text.

```js
while (chroma.contrast(currentColor, foregroundColor) < 4.5) {
    currentColor = chroma(currentColor).darken(0.001);
}
```

> While the contrast ratio between `currentColor` and `foregroundColor` is less than 4.5, darken the `currentColor` by 0.1%

Which results in [Dracula Flat Light](#dracula-flat-light).

### Light Theme Darker

The WCAG also has a AAA or [_"Contrast (Enhanced)"_](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-enhanced) recommendation of 7:1. Using the same method as above we can do the following to create a slightly darker syntax variant of the Light Theme:

```js
while (chroma.contrast(currentColor, foregroundColor) < 7) {
    currentColor = chroma(currentColor).darken(0.001);
}
```

Which results in [Dracula Flat Light Darker](#dracula-flat-light-darker).
This provides an even darker color syntax for those who prefer it.
